## Next Steps

After filling out this template:

1. **Review your answers** - Make sure everything is clear and complete
2. **Prioritize features** - Identify what's truly essential vs. nice-to-have
3. **Create a PRD** - Use the PRD template to create a detailed specification
4. **Generate tasks** - Use TaskMaster AI to break down your PRD into actionable tasks
5. **Start building** - Begin implementation with your task list

## Tips for Better Requirements

- **Be specific** - "User-friendly" is vague, "Complete task in under 30 seconds" is specific
- **Think about edge cases** - What happens when things go wrong?
- **Consider all user types** - New users, power users, admins, etc.
- **Start simple** - You can always add features later
- **Validate assumptions** - Talk to potential users early and often
